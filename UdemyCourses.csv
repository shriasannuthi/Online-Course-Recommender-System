AWS Certified Security Specialty Questions Bank Updated,,,0.0,https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-security-specialty-questions-bank-updated/,"AWS Certified Security Specialty Questions Bank Updated 2021. 4 Practice Exams. 325 Questions. Some Questions:. A new application will be deployed on EC2 instances in private subnets. The application will transfer sensitive data to and from an S3 bucket. Compliance requirements state that the data must not traverse the public internet.Which solution meets the compliance requirement?. a) Access the S3 bucket through the SSL protected S3 endpoint (Incorrect). B) Access the S3 bucket through a VPC endpoint for S3. C) Access the S3 bucket through a proxy server. D) Access the S3 bucket through a NAT gateway.. Explanation: The AWS(Amazon Web Service) Documentation mentions the following A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS(Amazon Web Service) services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS(Amazon Web Service) Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. Option A is invalid because using a proxy server is not sufficient enough Option B and D are invalid because you need secure communication which should not traverse the internet For more information on VPC endpoints. You need to ensure that objects in an S3 bucket are available in another region. This is because of the criticality of the data that is hosted in the S3 bucket.

Please note that provided three practice tests are mock exams, not brain dumps.

The multiple-choice questions are written with plausible distractors, using memory + application method that tests students' knowledge of principles and facts in real-life situations..

The Company is debating whether to use the Cloud Computing for their business application needs. Executive team is in a meeting to discuss and decide about their decision to embrace the Cloud. Executives seem to be worried about cost, security, ROI, capabilities, and ability to master the cloud administration.. If you were a fly on the wall of this meeting room what would you say to your cousin fly?. (A) AWS environment is by default more secure than on-premise environments.. (B) AWS environment cannot be more secured than on-premise environment because you own the building.. (C) AWS environment can be more secure than on-premise environment if well architected.. (D) AWS environment cannot achieve compliances as a cloud provider.. Correct Answer is C.. AWS environment can be more secure than on-premise environment if well architected.. [Question Difficulty Level = 65]. AWS environment can be more secure than on-premise environment if well architected because AWS provides several tools, capabilities, services, and market place solutions to secure your workload in AWS.. Sample Question 2:. [Question ID = HCC-AWS-PQ-1232]. The Startup has very little money but a lot of hope and potential. Their app is free for the customers. The app saves their user’s photos and converts it to thumbnails. The Startup wants to ensure that they can retrieve the actual photo and the thumbnail for 1 month. However, after 1 month, they are not too concerned about the thumbnail because they can recreate it if lost, however, they would like to keep it and not delete it and they can wait a few hours for the access to this file.. Which of the following approach will result in the most cost savings with regards to the thumbnail in operating their AWS environment?. (A) Configure S3 lifecycle to migrate data from S3 Standard to Glacier after 1 month.. (B) Configure S3 lifecycle to migrate data from S3 Standard to S3 RRS after 1 month.. (C) Configure S3 lifecycle to migrate data from S3 Standard to S3 IA after 1 month.. (D) Configure S3 lifecycle to migrate data from S3 Standard to S3 RRS after 1 month and back to S3 Standard after 6 months.. Correct Answer is A.. Configure S3 lifecycle to migrate data from S3 Standard to Glacier after 1 month.. [Question Difficulty Level = 75]. Configure S3 lifecycle to migrate data from S3 Standard to Glacier after 1 month.. S3 lifecycle policies allow you to migrate data from one class to another on a schedule. Moving data from S3 standard storage tier to other tiers such as S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed) or RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage) class or Glacier class will result in substantial cost saving by trading off on higher durability of the data.. Here, The Startup requirement is such that they need to have access to the actual photo and the thumbnail for 1 month and after that time they are less concerned about the durability and the amount of time it takes to access it. Glacier is extremely low cost storage solution for such a use case where it is acceptable that the access to data can take a few hours.",,IT & Software   IT Certifications   AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

An e-commerce company has its technology infrastructure deployed in hybrid mode with applications running in a single AWS Region as well as its on-premises data center. The company has a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection from the data center to AWS that is 70% utilized. The company wants to deploy a new flagship application on AWS that will connect with existing applications running on-premises. The application SLA requires a minimum of 99.9% network uptime between the on-premises data center and the AWS Cloud. The company has an AWS Enterprise Support plan.. Which of the following options would you recommend as the MOST cost-effective solution to address this requirement?. What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.... Correct: 4.. Correct option:. **Purchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect dedicated connection from AWS in a different Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing**. AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you create a private connection between AWS and your data center. AWS Direct Connect is compatible with all AWS services accessible over the internet, and is available in speeds starting at 50 Mbps and scaling up to 100 Gbps.. There are two types of Direct Connect connections:. Dedicated Connection: A physical Ethernet connection associated with a single customer. Customers can request a dedicated connection through the AWS Direct Connect console, the CLI, or the API.. Hosted Connection: A physical Ethernet connection that an AWS Direct Connect Partner provisions on behalf of a customer. Customers request a hosted connection by contacting a partner in the AWS Direct Connect Partner Program, which provisions the connection.. You can use local preference BGP community tags to achieve load balancing and route preference for incoming traffic to your network. For each prefix that you advertise over a BGP session, you can apply a community tag to indicate the priority of the associated path for returning traffic.. The following local preference BGP community tags are supported:. 7224:7100—Low preference. 7224:7200—Medium preference. 7224:7300—High preference. Local preference BGP community tags are mutually exclusive.. A Virtual Interface (VIF) is necessary to access AWS services, and can be either public, private or transit, like so:. Private virtual interface: A private virtual interface should be used to access an Amazon VPC using private IP addresses.. Public virtual interface: A public virtual interface can access all AWS public services using public IP addresses. A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3.. Transit virtual interface: A transit virtual interface should be used to access one or more Amazon VPC Transit Gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways. You can use transit virtual interfaces with 1/2/5/10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connections.. Exam alert - You should note the allowed VIF types for the various configurations of Direct Connect connections:. A Hosted Connection with a capacity of 500 Mbps or less can support one private VIF or one public VIF. A Hosted Connection with a capacity of 1 Gbps or more can support one private, public, or transit VIF. Each Hosted Connection supports a single VIF and you can obtain multiple VIFs by configuring multiple hosted connections.. Hosted VIFs can connect to public resources or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) in the same way as standard VIFs. However, the account that owns the VIF is different from the connection owner. Bandwidth is shared across all VIFs on the parent connection. A hosted VIF can support one private VIF or one public VIF.. A Dedicated Connection can support up to 50 public/private VIFs and 1 transit VIF.. “Uptime Target” means a percentage of Maximum Uptime in a monthly billing cycle applicable to your Included Resource, based upon meeting the Minimum Configuration Requirements. To ensure an uptime target of 99.9% as mandated in the given use case, the included resources should use virtual interfaces on Dedicated Connections at a minimum of 2 Direct Connect locations, and at least one of those Direct Connect locations uses the Associated AWS Region in which your workload is located.. Incorrect options:. **Purchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect hosted connection through an AWS Direct Connect partner in a different Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing**. **Purchase two new Direct Connect hosted connections of 5 Gbps each through an AWS Direct Connect partner. Provision two virtual interfaces (VIFs) to the existing VPC on both Direct Connect connections and use BGP for load balancing. Terminate the existing 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection**. As mentioned in the explanation above, to guarantee an SLA of 99.9%, you must use dedicated Direct Connect connections and NOT hosted connections. So both these options are incorrect.. **Purchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect dedicated connection from AWS in the existing Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing** - To guarantee an SLA of 99.9%, you must use dedicated Direct Connect connections at a minimum of 2 Direct Connect locations rather than a single Direct Connect location. So this option is incorrect.. References:. < reference links included >. =======. Instructor. My name is Stephane Maarek, and I'll be your instructor in this practice exam.

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.. Ref: <url>. Elastic Load Balancer.. is not correct.. Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, Lambda functions, and virtual appliances. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.. Ref: <url>. Cloud Trail.. is not correct.. Cloud Trail is pefect for this requirement. Unusual activity detection use case: You can detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts by enabling CloudTrail Insights. For example, you can quickly alert and act on operational issues such as erroneous spikes in resource provisioning or services hitting rate limits.. Ref: <url>. CloudFront.. is correct..

All questions have been. written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time!. =======. Quality speaks for itself.... SAMPLE QUESTION:. A silicon valley based unicorn startup recently launched a video-sharing social networking service called KitKot. The startup uses AWS Cloud to manage the IT infrastructure. Users upload video files up to 1 GB in size to a single EC2 instance based application server which stores them on a shared EFS file system. Another set of EC2 instances managed via an Auto Scaling group, periodically scans the EFS share directory for new files to process and generate new videos (for thumbnails and composite visual effects) according to the video processing instructions that are uploaded alongside the raw video files. Post-processing, the raw video files are deleted from the EFS file system and the results are stored in an S3 bucket. Links to the processed video files are sent via in-app notifications to the users. The startup has recently found that even as more instances are added to the Auto Scaling Group, many files are processed twice, therefore image processing speed is not improved.. As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, what would you recommend to improve the reliability of the solution as well as eliminate the redundant processing of video files?. What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.... Correct: 2.. Refactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function on each video file upload to S3 that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from the SQS queue and the S3 bucket. Configure the queue depth metric to scale the size of the Auto Scaling group for video processing instances. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files. For the given use-case, the primary way to address the issues related to reliability, as well as redundant processing of video files, is by introducing SQS into the solution stack. SQS offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. SQS locks your messages during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers can receive messages at the same time. Using the right combination of delay queues and visibility timeout, you can optimize the solution to address use-cases where the consumer application needs additional time to process messages such as the one in this scenario. Messages are put into the SQS queue via a Lambda function that is triggered when a new video file is uploaded to S3 for processing.. To ensure that the consumer applications running on the video processing instances can scale via an Auto Scaling group, you could use the SQS queue depth (known as the CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric - ApproximateNumberOfMessages) as the underlying metric. However, the issue with using a CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric like ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible for target tracking is that the number of messages in the queue might not change proportionally to the size of the Auto Scaling group that processes messages from the queue. An optimized solution would be to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain.. Incorrect options:. Refactor the application to run from Amazon S3 instead of the EFS file system and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket via an API Gateway based REST API. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function each time a file is uploaded and the Lambda, in turn, processes the video and stores the processed files in another bucket. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files. - API Gateway supports payload size of only up to 10 MB therefore this option is incorrect for the given use-case since you need to support file sizes of up to 1GB for video processing.. Refactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Set CloudWatch Events to trigger a Lambda function on each file upload that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from SQS queue for new files and configure the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files. - CloudWatch Events cannot trigger a Lambda function upon a new file upload in S3 as this event pattern is not supported.. S3 supports only the following destinations where it can publish events - SNS, SQS and Lambda. Therefore this option is incorrect.. Create an hourly cron job on the application server to synchronize the contents of the EFS share with S3. Trigger a Lambda function every time a file is uploaded to S3 and process the video file to store the results in another S3 bucket. Once the file is processed, leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files. - The issue with this option is lack of reliability. In case the Lambda function (which is triggered when a video file is uploaded to S3) fails to process a given video file, then the source video file would always remain unprocessed as there is no queue-based mechanism to re-process failed events. So this option is incorrect.. < with reference links>. =======. Instructor. My name is Stephane Maarek, and I'll be your instructor in this practice exam.

This is exam was very good in comparison to the real exam. =======. Quality speaks for itself.... SAMPLE QUESTION:. You have migrated an on-premise SQL Server database to an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database attached to a VPC inside a private subnet. Also, the related Java application, hosted on-premise, has been moved to an Amazon Lambda function.. Which of the following should you implement to connect AWS Lambda function to its RDS instance?. What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.... Correct: 4.. CORRECT OPTION. Configure Lambda to connect to VPC with private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS. - You can configure a Lambda function to connect to private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your account. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your lambda function to the VPC to access private resources during execution. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates an elastic network interface for each combination of the security group and subnet in your function's VPC configuration. This is the right way of giving RDS access to Lambda.. INCORRECT OPTIONS. Use Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately. - You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. Layers will not help in configuring access to RDS instance and hence is an incorrect choice.. Configure lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use the Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet. - This is an incorrect statement. Connecting a Lambda function to a public subnet does not give it internet access or a public IP address. To grant internet access to your function, its associated VPC must have a NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet.. Use Environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string. - You can use environment variables to store secrets securely and adjust your function's behavior without updating code. You can use environment variables to exchange data with RDS, but you will still need access to RDS, which is not possible with just environment variables.. =======. Instructor.

Excellent test prep.. I passed with a score of 1000. !!. If you just do Stephane's Solution Architect course and this test course, you will pass the certification for sure. Ankur W.. =======. Quality speaks for itself.... SAMPLE QUESTION:. A social gaming startup has its flagship application hosted on a fleet of EC2 servers running behind an Elastic Load Balancer. These servers are part of an Auto Scaling Group. 90% of the users start logging into the system at 6 pm every day and continue till midnight. The engineering team at the startup has observed that there is a significant performance lag during the initial hour from 6 pm to 7 pm. The application is able to function normally thereafter.. As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend addressing the performance bottleneck during that initial hour of traffic spike?. What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.... Correct: 1.. The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. The engineering team can create a daily scheduled action to kick-off before 6pm and hence this is the correct option.. Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions as the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances. For example, you could install or configure software on newly launched instances, or download log files from an instance before it terminates. Lifecycle hooks are not the correct choice for this use-case.. With target tracking scaling policies, you choose a scaling metric and set a target value. Application Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value.. With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods.. Both the target tracking as well as step scaling policies entail a lag wherein the instances will be provisioned only when the underlying CloudWatch alarms go off. Therefore we would still see performance lag during some part of the initial hour.. =======. Instructor. My name is Stephane Maarek, and I'll be your instructor in this practice exam.
